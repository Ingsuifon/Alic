# Build
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

# Experiments
Just execute the `run.py`. You can change datasets, corresponding integer columns to be compressed and batch size.

# DST
We have already generated many DSTs which are sufficient. You can also try to generate them by using `DecodingTest`.
